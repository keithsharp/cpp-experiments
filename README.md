# C++ Experiments
Small experiments with C++ and associated tools.

+ [`cmake-basic`](https://github.com/keithsharp/cpp-experiments/tree/main/cmake-basic) - simple, single C++ file CMake example.
+ [`cmake-subdir`](https://github.com/keithsharp/cpp-experiments/tree/main/cmake-subdir) - include source files from a subdirectory.

## Pre-requisites
Stuff you need to make this work, mainly for macOS:

1. Examples use Clang++ as a compiler, get this by installing Xcode (or just the tools).
2. Install CMake using HomeBrew: `brew install cmake`.

VS Code Extensions:
1. [C/C++ for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools).
2. [CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools)
